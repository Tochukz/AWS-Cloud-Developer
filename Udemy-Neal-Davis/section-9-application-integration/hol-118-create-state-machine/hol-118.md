# Create State Machine - HOL-118

### Description

This configuration demonstrates the use of a State Machine.  
Here we have 3 Lambda functions being orchestrated - `AdditionFunc`, `MultiplicationFunc` and `DivisionFunc`.

The `AdditionFunc` generates two random numbers (between 0 -1 ) and adds them up.  
The StateMachine checks the result and sends the result to the `MultiplicationFunc` if the result is less then 1, otherwise, the result get sends to the `DivisionFunc`.

The `MultilicationFunc` multiplies any result sent to it by 10.  
The `DivisionFunc` divides any result sent to it by 10.

A State Machine can also take input from the start.
This can be deomonstrated in another example.

### Operation

**Before deployment**

**Deployment**

Lint the templates

```bash
$ cfn-lint StateMachine.yaml
```

Deploy the stack

```bash
$ aws cloudformation deploy --template-file StateMachine.yaml --stack-name StateMachine --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

**After deployment**

**Testing**

1. Go to the Step Function Console
2. Go to StateMachines > select the `SimpleMachine`
3. Click the _Start Execution_ button.
4. You can click on the rectangle box to see the result from each step in the process.
5. You can click on the _New Execution_ button to trigger another execution.

**Cleanup**

To delete the stack

```bash
$ aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name StateMachine
```
