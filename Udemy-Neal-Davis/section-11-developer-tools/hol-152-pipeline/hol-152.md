# Create Pipeline and Application - HOL-152

### Description

The configurations demonstrates how to setup a CodePipeline to deploy NodeJS application Code from GitHub Code repository to an Elastic Beanstalk environment.
Here we have two stacks:

1. `BeanstalkApp` - deploys an Elastic Beanstalk Application and Environment
2. `Pipeline` - sets up the Code Pipeline that automatically deploys GitHub code to the Elastic Beanstalk when code is pushed to the Github repository

### Operation

**Before deployment**

1. Package the code  
   Package the application code and upload to S3 bucket for the BeanStalk Application.

```bash
$ bash ./deploy.sh
```

2. Generate a GitHub access token  
   See the steps outlined in `hol-150-git-and-github` on how to generate access token from your GitHub account.  
   To test your generated Test Github token

```bash
$ export token=ghp-your-github-access-token
$  curl -H "Authorization: token $token" https://api.github.com/repos/Tochukz/node-app-24-06
```

**Deployment**

Lint the templates

```bash
$ cfn-lint BeanstalkApp
$ cfn-lint Pipeline.yaml
```

1. Deploy the `BeanstalkApp` stack

```bash
$ aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name BeanstalkApp --template-file BeanstalkApp.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

2. Deploy the `Pipeline` stack

```bash
$ aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name Pipeline --template-file Pipeline.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --parameter-overrides file://secret-parameters.json
```

**After deployment**

Get the `EnvironmentURL` from the `BeanstalkApp` stack outputs

```bash
$ aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name BeanstalkApp --query "Stacks[0].Outputs" --no-cli-pager
```

Use the `EnvironmentURL` to test the Beanstalk application over a Browser.

**Testing**

1. Go to the CodePipeline Console to take, select the Pipeline
2. You can manually trigger a release by clicking on the _Release Change_ button.
3. If you push new code to the master branch of the GitHub repo configured for the Pipeline, you will see an automatic release go into effect.
4. Revisit the Application on the Browser after the deploy to confirm that changes you made to the application code.

**Cleanup**  
To delete the stacks

```bash
$ aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name Pipeline
$ aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name BeanstalkApp
```
