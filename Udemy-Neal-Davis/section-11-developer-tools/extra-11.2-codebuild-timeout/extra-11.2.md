__Question:__  
You're a developer working on a large scale order processing application. After developing the features, you commit your code to AWS CodeCommit and begin building the project with AWS CodeBuild before it gets deployed to the server. The build is taking too long and the error points to an issue resolving dependencies from a third-party. You would like to prevent a build running this long in the future for similar underlying reasons.

Which of the following options represents the best solution to address this use-case?

1. Use VPC Flow Logs
2. Use AWS CloudWatch Events
3. Use AWS Lambda
4. Enable CodeBuild timeouts
