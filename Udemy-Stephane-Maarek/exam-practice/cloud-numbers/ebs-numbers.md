__Provision IOPS to Volume Ratio__   
The maximum ratio of provisioned IOPS to requested volume size (in GiB) is _50:1_.  
So, for a _200 GiB_ volume size, max IOPS possible is 200*50 = 10,000 IOPS.  
* IOPS:volume Size = 50:1
* Remember that Max Volume size if _16TiB_
* And max IOPS is _64,000 IOPS_
* Min Volume size is 4GiB
